# REACT LEARNING
## DESCRIBING THE UI SUMMARY
What is React?
A JS library for rendering user interfaces build from small re-useable nestable units called components.

Rendering - process of generating and displaying a visual representation 
based on underlying markup, data and/or code.

What are components syntactically?
Javascript functions sprinkled with markup.
```js
function Profile(){
    return ( 
        <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW4As.jpg"
            alt="Katherine Johnson"
        />
    );
}
export default function Gallery() {
    return (
        <section>
            <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
            <Profile />
            <Profile />
            <Profile />
        </section>
    );
}
```
Common convention is to `export default function Gallery` because it allows you to `import Gallery from ./Gallery`
You can also rename the component upon import with default export, but the runs against convention. For files with multiple
components you could just use export for a normal named export.
Ex:
```js
export const FooterComponent = () => {
    return <footer> hi </footer>
}
export default MainComponent; //some other component defined in this file

//in another file
import MainComponent, {FooterComponent} from './PathToFile'
//shows slight difference in how import looks for named vs default imports
```

What is JSX?
A markup language that looks a lot like HTML, its a bit stricter and can display dynamic info.
You can't always copy paste html but if you want you can use an html to jsx converter.
A component MUST return a single html parent element. If you want your component function to return multiple
sibling elements you must wrap the whole thing in `<> </>` this is the shorthand for React.Fragment. You could also use
<React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>
```js
function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>The Title</h1>
            <p>The essay</p>
        </>
)
}
```

Javascript in JSX curly braces
Single curly braces allow you a window to access things you may have defined in js earlier.
Ex: <div style = {person.theme}>

Props - React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information
to its child components by giving them props. These may remind you of HTML attributes. BUT!!!! you can pass any JS value
through them: objects, arrays functions event JSX 

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}
```

You can use conditional logic within a component to decide if it gets rendered or not. For example a js variable
isPacked could decide whether a checkbox is used or not.

Rendering lists
Make use of filter and map to transform your array of data into an array of components.

Components should be pure functions!
Do not change any objects or variables that exist before they were called.
Given the same inputs a functions should always return the same result.

Your UI as a tree
React Render Tree: Root Component Renders children all the way down to leaf components.
React module dependency tree. Root components import child components which in turn might
import their own child components all the way down to leafs.
