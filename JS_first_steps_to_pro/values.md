JS has two kinds of data
1. Primitives (ex: strings and numbers)
2. Objects (document & friends)

undefined - accidental nothing
null - deliberate nothing

Strings
Know that there is a `.length` method
You can index them myString[0] to get letters
You can do `indexOf` to find where something is
There is an `includes` to see if a substring is part of it.
you can also use `.startsWith` to see if beginning is substring

Comparison Operators
=== and !== strict ones.

```js
let bankruptcy; //just declaring a var
bankruptcy = 5; //assigning a value to that variable
```
