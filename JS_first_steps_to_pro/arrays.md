# Arrays
These have a .length and can be indexed.
These can be empty, hold a single item and they can contain mixed types.

## Methods
.sort()
["lions","tigers","bears oh my!".join("&")
[1,2,3].concat([4,5,6])

## Mutability
Mutable data like arrays can be edited. Strings and other primitives are immutable and cannot be.
